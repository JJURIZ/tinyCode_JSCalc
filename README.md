tinyCode project - creating a JavaScript calculator

Desiring to create something from scratch I chose this, the calculator, based on numerous recommendations online. 
I loved working on this and found myself completely immersed in solving problems that cropped up. The thorniest issue was 
what to do when a user performed an operation and then continued to click the 'equals' button. Using the MS CALC app as guidance
I worked out the same functionality (continuing to perform the previous operation on the last number selected). 

Though this is the equivelent of a child's painting, and I have learned so much since this was written, I will be proud of this project forever because of the experience.
